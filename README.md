# Better dupe

**Ever had the issue where the default duplication tool nearly crashes your game? 
Or had massive lag spikes whenever someone spawns dupes in?**

Fear no more!

This addon fixes those exact issues.
Instead of spawning all props and constraints from a dupe in a single tick (like the default duplicator tool does), this addon makes it so it's all spawned over a larger period of time to spread out the lag of creating entities.

Credits to [advanced dupe](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=773402917) for having a great spawning system!
